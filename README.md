## Project Description
During a regular season each nfl team will play 17 games with 1 bye week. Each week there are 14 to 16 games played. The purpose of this project is to determine if the home team will win for each game each week of the regular season. 

### Data Collection
The data collected for this project was either downloaded or copied from the websites listed in the resource section above. All files were formated to csv files to be imported using pandas and python.
